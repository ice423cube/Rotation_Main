  <li>Hit Save Blocks</li>
  <li>Configure the block &quot;Rotation Location # (Rotation Main)&quot; in this case since is our first one it is Rotation Location 1 (Rotation Main)
    <ul>
      <li>Select the Location you want from the drop down. Since this is the first Rotation we will use the default location &quot;Home Page&quot; you can use this for any page it does not have to be the Home Page it is just a place holder name and you can even change the name in the taxonomy section of the website.
        <ul>
          <li>Do not see what you are looking for or want to change the default &quot;Home Page&quot; to a different name.

      <li>Edit Thumbnail Information
        <ul>
          <li>Thumbnail Width: Choose a Width for your thumbnail images.

          <li>Thumbnail Height: Choose a Height for your thumbnail images. If Filmstrip Style is set to &quot;Numbers with Pop-up Thumbnails&quot; then this value is ignored. Please Note: Make sure the images you are posting are set to this height. If they are larger they will be cropped.</li>
          <li>Numbers with Pop-up Thumbnails Background Color Only: If Filmstrip Style is set to &quot;Thumbnails&quot; then this value is ignored. This controls the color of the background of the numbers and the pop-up. Drag the color chart below to pick a color. The outside ring selects the color and the inside square changes the lightness or darkness of that color.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Edit Caption Information
        <ul>
          <li>Show Captions: Selecting &quot;yes&quot; will allow you to see captions under each thumbnail in the filmstrip.</li>
          <li>Captions Height: This is the height of the caption area. 20 = 20px in height. If you have a longer caption you might want to make this a larger number. You can adjust the line-height be changing the &quot;.caption&quot; class.</li>

<h2><strong><a name="node" id="node"></a></strong>Can I have a single Rotation Item show up in more than one place:</h2>
<p>  Yes, it is easy.  All you have to do is open the node that you want to share across multiple Locations and scroll down to the Locations section and check any additional locations you want it to show up in.  There is a known issue that the is only one weight.  So you might have to work the weights between the multiple to get it to show up where you want in each rotation.  But aside from that it is simple.</p>
<p><a href="#menu">Back To Top</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="known"></a>Known Issues:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>  Numbers with Pop-up Thumbnails can not have to many listing in it or it breaks and hides the arrows.</li>
  <li>One Rotation Item (Node) in multiple rotations blocks on a site needs to be played with because there is only one weight field per item.  So to get them to show up in the correct place in both rotations you need to play with the weight number. </li>
  <li><strong>Please Note:</strong> You can only use one Rotation Block on a page at a time. If you add multiple to one page it will break. You can have multiple rotations on your website just not on the same page.</li>
  <li>Multiple JS scripts with the same name does cause bugs.  You might need to remove them from your theme layer so they do not conflict with this module.</li>
